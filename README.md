# ChessAI
 
A chess engine from scratch and attempted NN/RL bot.

As of March 1, the chess engine is completed and fully functional, and can be run in the console through engine_runner.py.
A visual client using pygames is being coded, currently functional in GUI.py but with some missing functionality (like game end screen). I am working on that and some more options and niceties in the client.
Nothing NN/RL has been attempted yet.

Environment:
I coded this in Python 3.9-3.10, using two pip packages, pygame and stockfish, that can be installed by running:
pip install pygame
pip install stockfish
in your environment.
