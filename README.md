# ChessAI
 
A chess engine from scratch and attempted NN/RL bot.

As of March 1, the chess engine is completed and fully functional, and can be run in the console through engine_runner.py.
A barebones visual client using pygames is being coded, currently functional in GUI.py but with a crippling bug in the promoting code. This bug will be fixed soon, along with some more options and niceties in the client.
Nothing NN/RL has been attempted yet.
